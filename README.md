The National Basketball Association (NBA) has changed since the introduction of the 3-point line back in the 1979-80 season. In the beginning, teams were reluctantly shooting 3-pointers while today, players like Steph Curry and James Harden are leading a “3-point revolution”. Basketball went from a “big guy” game to a positionless sport, based on spacing and long-range shots. But what kind of story do the stats tell? Do they agree or do they show something else?

The interactive plot is a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of 29 stat categories for all NBA teams since season 1979-80 and on. A PCA plot is a very handy way to combine multiple statistical categories (points per game, 3-point shots per game etc.) and make a simple and understandable plot. It's not perfect but it gives a pretty good overview!

The color of each dot represents the amount of wins during the regular season (teams with more wins have brighter colors. The slider at the bottom allows to move through the seasons and see the evolution of NBA teams. The drop down menu at the top selects one NBA team and shows its position on the plot for all seasons. Vovering over the dots reveals the name of the team and the season. Panning and zooming (box and wheel) is also possible!

The x-axis (left to right) is the most important for separating the teams (explains 38.8% of the variation in the data) and the y-axis (vertical) is less important. If you move the slider, you'll notice the teams moving from right to left unti the 2000s and from the lower left corner to the upper left, during the 2010s.  The right -> left movement means that teams 
 



Principal component 1 () accounts for 38.8% of the variation in the data (teams). Its largest loadings come from 2PA, 3PA, 3P%, TOV and ORB, meaning that the variation of teams along the x-axis is due to the changes in the aforementioned statistical categories. Along the x-axis, the teams separate mainly based on their decade, as the colors indicate. The 80s teams, relying mainly on 2-point shots, committing more personal fouls, turning the ball over more often and collecting more offensive rebounds, cluster on the right side of the plot while the newest (00sand10s), shooting more 3-point shots with higher percentages, cluster on the left side. The 90s teams are in-between, in the lower, middle part of the plot. Principal component 2explains 20.4% of the variance in the data an separates the modern (10s) teams from the ones of the previous decade(00s), along the y-axis. Its highest loadings come from DRB, 2P% and PTS, meaning that in the last decade teams collected more defensive rebounds, improved their 2-point shot percentages and scored more points. The 80s teams are also higher up on the y-axis suggesting that they also had higher numbers in the aforementioned three categories compared to the 90s and 00steams.

Among the teams worth highlighting are the recent Budenholzer-lead Bucks, that are clearly separating from the rest of the NBA teams. They are on the upper extreme of the plot, even further than the recent Warriors dynasty. The mid-00s Phoenix Suns seem like a pioneer team for its time, separating from the group of the other 00s teams and moving to the modern 3-point dominated era earlier than the rest, only to be followed almost ten years later by teams like the Rockets and the Warriors. The late 90s-early 00s Chicago Bulls (after Jordan’s retirement) are on the lower left extreme of the plot, separating from the other 90s-00s teams, by having very few points per game and wins per regular season.
